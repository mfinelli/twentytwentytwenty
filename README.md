# twentytwentytwenty

A simple application to fire a notification every twenty minutes to look at
something twenty feet away for twenty seconds. The 20/20/20 method is supposed
to help reduce eye strain from staring at a computer screen all day.

Currently only tested on Linux, but I'd like to add support for macOS too.
